# Single Layer Perceptron on Penguins Dataset 
Penguins' dataset contains 150 samples (50 samples/class). Each sample consists of 5 features
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Penguins (Adelie, Gentoo and Chinstrap).
Five features were measured from each sample: bill_length, bill_depth, flipper_length, gender and body_mass, (in millimeter).
The first part of the task is analyzing the data and making a simple report to know the linear/non-linear separable features.
The model consist of two pahses : train and test
We will use the penguins data in both training and testing processes.
(Each class has 50 samples: train NN with 30 non-repeated samples randomly selected, and test it with the remaining 20 samples)
